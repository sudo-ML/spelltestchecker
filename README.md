I created this app to help me solve a problem at work.
When we were choosing new spelling test words for the students, we didn't have a method 
to check if they had already been assigned those spelling test for a previous week.

This app will check new_words.txt against all other .txt files in the same folder and
tell you if any words in new_words.txt match words in other files. And tell you which file.
The list of words you wish to check MUST be called new_words.txt or this app will not work.
